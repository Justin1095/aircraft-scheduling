# Aircraft Scheduling

This project is an application that does aircraft scheduling.

## Assumptions

- The date on the header will display tomorrow's date because the assessment's description states, "Only one day worth of schedule can be entered (“tomorrow”)."
- Page will initally load with only the Aircrafts. Once an aircraft is selected, then the Flights will display.
- Rotation and Timeline will display once a Flight is selected.
- Timeline has a description explaining it.
- When clicking on an aircraft, it resets the Rotation and Flights.
- The Flights are sorted by departure time.
- The arrows in the header date should move the date back or forward (I did not add the functionality in).
- If user clicks on the last Rotation Flight, it will remove it from the Rotation and update the Flights.
- Descriptions will be displayed under the section telling the user how to use the application.

## Future Plans

- add Jest unit testing
- add functionality to the date header arrows
- make the page be more visually pleasing
